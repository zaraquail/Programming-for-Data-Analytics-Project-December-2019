You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose."

    "I work for a company providing non-pharmacological therapy and activity sessions for people living with dementia. There are free group sessions offered at community centres in the area in which the company are working. The therapies and activities are most effective when applied regularly and it has been shown that regular attendance is related to better outcomes. However there are some attendees who do not attend regularly or who stop attending. People living with dementia have a number of symptoms affecting their cognition for which cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) has been shown to be an effective non-pharmacological intervention with results comparable to pharmaceutical trial outcomes,[1][2] and is recommended by national and international guideline.[3][4] Cognitive stimulation is defined as “engaging in a range of activities and discussions that are aimed at general improvement of cognitive and social functioning”.[3] CST is recommended for people with mild to moderate dementia and is usually delivered in a group setting.[3] Numerous trials have shown that CST is an effective treatment to improve cognition (including memory, orientation, language and visuospatial abilities) and quality of life in people with mild to moderate dementia.[2] The group session are usually delivered as a 14-session programme delivered twice a week over 7 weeks in a group setting.[1][5] However, in order to ensure efficacy of the intervention, regular attendance at the group sessions over the 7 weeks is required. In planning implementation of community-based group cognitive stimulation therapy sessions in the real-world setting for the company I work for, we aim to identify potential barriers to group session attendance and plan measures to overcome barriers to attendance. The barriers in this case are specific variables. In assessing the potential variables and data relating to this, I have looked for studies that assess barriers to attendance at group activities for older people, where possible focusing on those living with dementia in the community (rather than in care homes or residential facilities). Studies on implementation of CST programmes in various communities are still underway,[6] but in general, identified barriers to dementia care programmes and the likes of CST include lack of awareness of dementia and available supports; training and support of staff to deliver CST; cultural, gender and age issues; language barriers; transport and proximity to the centre in which the programme is delivered.[6][7] While our staff are already trained in CST and there is a community engagement team increasing awareness on dementia, there are modifiable issues that the company can potentially address to ensure attendance at group sessions. Based on previous experience in setting up the group sessions, I hypothesise that the relevant variables affecting attendance may include the stage or severity of the dementia, the distance at which the participant lives from the community centre, available support in their living environment, their mobility and related to mobility, their available transport and their home language. I would like to address the issues for which we could arrange relevant interventions of they were deemed to be a significant variable in terms of attendance namely, getting to the centre and participating with the relevant language translator if needed. In some instances, there is no specific available research relevant to the variable so I have had to deduce a relevant range based on the current experience in designing the service. Even though some of the variables have had to be estimated, e.g., distance to the centre based on the fact that attendees currently are from 2 different wards, so distance was based on the maximum distance from the perimeters.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in creating a data set, I would like to synthesis and model a data set thay may help establish if there is a link between non-attendance at groups sessions and certain modifiable variables which are shown in Table 1 below.\n",

    "### Table 1: Variables and descriptions of inputs for dataset\n",

    "| sessions | Number of sessions attended out of 14 sessions | Numeric vector between 1 to 14 |\n",
    "| distance | Distance of home from community centre in kilometers | Numeric vector between 0 and 50 |\n",
    "| mobility | Mobility indicating use of mobility aid e.g., walks unaided, walks with walking aid (walking stick, cane, walker), uses wheelchair | Text options unaided, aid, wheelchair |\n",
    "| transport | Usual mode of transport e.g., owncar=own car, familycar=family or spouse car, public=public transport, pedestrian=pedestrian, bicycle=bicycle) | Text options owncar, familycar, public, pedestrian, bicycle |\n",
