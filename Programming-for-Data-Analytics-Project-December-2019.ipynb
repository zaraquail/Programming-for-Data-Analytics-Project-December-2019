    "I work for a company providing non-pharmacological therapy and activity sessions for people living with dementia. There are free group sessions offered at community centres in the area in which the company are working. The therapies and activities are most effective when applied regularly and it has been shown that regular attendance is related to better outcomes. However there are some attendees who do not attend regularly or who stop attending. I would like to work out if there is a link between non-attendance and certain variables which are shown in Table 1 below.\n",
